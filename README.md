# ML-For-Compiler-based-Graph-Representation

In this exploration, we look to see if we can improve overall performance by combining the benefit of the compiler-based graph representations (that encode application-specific knowledge) with the benefit of the well-researched, high-performance LSTM-based models by sequentializing the graph representations.
